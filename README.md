👨💻 I'm currently working on...
Building REST APIs with Node.js/Express, automating deployment pipelines with Jenkins, and containerizing everything that moves using Docker. (RIP to my laptop's RAM 💀)

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on...
Open-source DevOps tools, backend microservices projects, or cloud infrastructure experiments. Extra hype if it involves AWS/GCP or chaotic-yet-educational CI/CD configurations.

🆘 I'm looking for help with...
Leveling up my Kubernetes game, Terraform best practices, and understanding why my containers sometimes ghost me. Also open to war stories about debugging prod issues!

📚 I'm currently learning...
• Cloud architecture patterns (the "how to not get a $5k AWS bill" edition)
• Scaling backend services without crying
• Writing YAML files that don’t look like alphabet soup

💬 Ask me about...
• My love/hate relationship with Bash scripting
• That time I accidentally DDOSed myself during load testing
• Why Jenkins pipelines feel like herding cats
• My quest to find the perfect terminal color scheme

🎉 Fun fact
I once tried to "optimize" a server by deleting log files... and learned about logrotate the hard way 😅

🚀 2024 Goal
Deploy a personal project using full infra-as-code (Terraform + Docker + Cloud) without any "oh $#!%" rollbacks.
